In Java, access modifiers are keywords used to control the
visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, fields, and other members within a class.
There are four main access modifiers in Java:

public: Accessible from anywhere.
private: Accessible only within the same class.
protected: Accessible within the same class, subclasses(not necessarily in the same package),
and other classes in the same package.
Default (package-private): Accessible within the same package.
