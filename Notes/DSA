Well Defined - Questions, Inputs and Output

Time Complexity:-
    Best - O(1) - Constant Time. (Basic and Decision Making)
    Good - O(n) - Linear Time. (Loop)
    Bad - O(n^2) - Quadratic Time. (Nested Loop)
    Worst - O(log n) - Logarithmic Time (Divide and Conquer)

Sorting:-
A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.
